* Passthrough request/response body "native" to client implementation
  - OkHttp Request/Response and ResponseBody, Call object from newCall
  - RestTemplate ClientHttpResponse/HttpEntity/ClientHttpResponse/ResponseEntity
* Better testing of InputStream
  - We close underlying response whether it's a stream or not
  - Exceptions leave stream open until the outer layer translates the exception or if not, closes it
  - AbstractInvokingDude converts non-Breeze exceptions
* Allow encoded path/query variables?

* what to say about OkHttp3 posting input streams (not supported because redirects/retries)

* Request.convertedBody
